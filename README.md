## Aim:

This project has reached a point where I need to define a proper aim for it. I have noticed that there might be a market for very nich√© genres and topics that people might want to connect teachers and students better in. I want this project to be a tool they can use for just that! We will try our best to move forward in such a direction that it is more easily customisable and flexible.
